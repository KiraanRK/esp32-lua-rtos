# Lua-RTOS-ESP32

This component has been extracted from Lua-RTOS-ESP32/components/lua_rtos

The original implementation is in the "vendor" branch of this repository, which periodically will be updated with new vendor drops and merged into the master branch.

You can add this as a git submodule to your project, or add `EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS` to your Makefile and check out this project (and other components) into your extra_components directory.

```
EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS := $(EXTRA_COMPONENTS_PATH)
```
